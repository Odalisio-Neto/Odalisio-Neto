# Hello, I'm Odalisio Leite da Silva Neto! ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about Computer Science and Data Science, with a special interest in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Android Development and data analysis. Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in advanced Deep Learning topics and developing personal projects that integrate Android with AI.

## Featured Projects

Here are some of my most relevant projects:

### 1. [BankNote-Detector](https://github.com/Odalisio-Neto/BankNote-Detector)

An Android application designed to detect and classify Brazilian banknotes using the device's camera and a Tensorflow Lite model.

**Technologies Used**:
- Kotlin
- Machine Learning
- OpenCV

### 2. [Test Case Descriptor Summarization](https://github.com/Odalisio-Neto/Test-Case-Descriptor)

This project provides a lightweight pipeline to automatically clean and summarize software test case descriptions using four transformer-based models (T5, Flanâ€‘T5, BART, and a custom fineâ€‘tuned T5), then evaluates their outputs with ROUGE metrics and exports the results for integration into testing workflows.

**Technologies Used**:
- PyTorch
- NLTK
- Hugging Face (Transformers)

### 3. [LNN-Futebol](https://github.com/Odalisio-Neto/LNN-Futebol)

A 'Neural = Symbolic' framework for sound and complete weighted real-value logic, integrating neural networks and symbolic logic.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python
- Artificial Intelligence
- Symbolic Logic

### 4. [Generative AI for Beginners](https://github.com/Odalisio-Neto/generative-ai-for-beginners-microsoft)

An introductory course with 18 lessons to get started with Generative AI.

**Technologies Used**:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- TypeScript

### 5. [Spatial-Relations](https://github.com/Odalisio-Neto/Spatial-Relations)

Python scripts for generating and manipulating bounding boxes in computer vision applications.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python
- Computer Vision
- Matplotlib
